# /sench-competitive-landscape

Competitive landscape analysis with dual focus for venture design.

## What It Does

Maps the competitive environment with two complementary lenses: direct market competition per segment and international benchmarks for inspiration. Identifies value gaps where competitive intensity is low and surfaces patterns from more advanced markets.

## Dual Focus

### Part 1: Direct Competition
- Market structure analysis (concentrated vs fragmented)
- Key player profiles with positioning, financials, trajectory
- Competitive intensity mapping by sub-segment
- Value gap identification (segment, geographic, feature, price)

### Part 2: International Benchmarks
- Market maturity comparison across geographies
- Inspirational player profiles
- Product, GTM, pricing pattern recognition
- Funding trajectory signals
